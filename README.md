# 3D Terrain Generation in Processing

Welcome to the `3DTerrainGenerationJava` repository! This project showcases a 3D animated terrain generation sketch in Processing. Utilizing Perlin noise for naturalistic terrain variations, the code dynamically creates a landscape that evolves over time. The visualization uses triangle strips and vertices to render the terrain, offering a captivating exploration of virtual landscapes.

## Prerequisites

- [Processing 3](https://processing.org/download/) or later.

## Setup and Running

1. Install Processing: Ensure you have Processing installed on your computer. You can download it from the [Processing website](https://processing.org/download/).

2. Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/Marqui-13/3DTerrainGenerationJava.git


3. Open the Sketch: Open Processing, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository, and open `3dtg.pde`.

4. Run the Sketch: Press the "Play" button or use the `Ctrl + R` shortcut to start the sketch. You will see a 3D terrain that continuously changes, simulating flying over a landscape.

## Exploring the Terrain

The sketch parameters, such as `scl` (scale), `w` (width), and `h` (height), can be adjusted to modify the terrain's appearance and size. Additionally, the speed of the "flying" effect is controlled by the `flying` variable, which can be tweaked to suit your visualization preferences.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance the 3D terrain generation sketch, optimize its performance, or improve documentation are welcome. Please fork the repository, commit your changes, and submit a pull request.
